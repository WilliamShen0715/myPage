		<p class="ncku">
		NCKU values holistic education, providing creative and lively instruction that combines large- and small-class study and emphasizes interdisciplinary learning. Selected courses taught entirely in English are offered in 27 departments.
		</p>
		<p class="ncku">
		The school seeks to cultivate world-class, internationally competitive individuals with sincerity and high moral integrity, characteristics that put NCKU graduates among the candidates most sought after by the business community.</p>
		<p class="ncku">
		Having laid down a solid foundation in engineering and then expanded into liberal arts and science, NCKU gradually developed into a comprehensive university, establishing colleges such as Medicine and Social Sciences, and even an Art Center and a Museum. The school has repeatedly received funding from the Ministry of Education under the â€œAim for the Top University Project" and is widely recognized as a leading university in Taiwan. Looking to the future, NCKU aims to become a worldclass research university with equal emphasis on outstanding teaching quality. Our development strategy has three foci: human resource development, developing distinctive academic strengths, and sustainable infrastructure, in order to keep abreast of other top universities in the world.</p>
